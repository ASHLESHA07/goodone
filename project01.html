        grasses and more. The constituents of forests which are trees and plants form a major part of the
        forests. Furthermore, they create a <b>healthy environment</b> so that various species of animals can
        breed and live there<b> happily</b>. Therefore, we see how forests are a habitat for a plethora of wild
        animals and birds. In addition to being of use to wildlife, forests benefit mankind greatly and hold
        immense significance.</em> </P></center></div>

    <P><em>“At night, when the sky is full of stars and the sea is still you get the wonderful sensation that you are
        floating in space.” – Natalie Wood
        “When anxious, uneasy and bad thoughts come, I go to the sea, and the sea drowns them out with its great wide
        sounds, cleanses me with its noise, and imposes a rhythm upon everything in me that is bewildered and confused.”
        – Rainer Maria Rilke
        “The sea! the sea! the open sea! The blue, the fresh, the ever free!” – Bryan W. Procter
        “The sea is a desert of waves, A wilderness of water.” – Langston Hughes
        “To me, the sea is like a person — like a child that I’ve known a long time. It sounds crazy, I know, but when I
        swim in the sea I talk to it. I never feel alone when I’m out</em></P></div><BR></center>
